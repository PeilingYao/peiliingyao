  <h1> Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Coordinated Development Strategy and Regional Economic Growth</h1>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This paper employs the PSM-DID method and Dynamic DID to analyze the impact of the Beijing- Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development strategy on the economic development of 13 covered cities. The results indicate that: 
    <p>(1) Overall, the implementation of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development policy has a positive effect on promoting economic development in the policy-covered areas, but this effect gradually be- comes evident only after 1-2 years. </p>
    <p>(2) For cities like Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Hengshui, and Langfang, this policy has promoted their economic development. However, for cities like Tangshan, Handan, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde, the implementation of this policy has hindered the growth of per capita GDP and GDP. </p>
    <p>(3) The economic growth in this region has primarily exhibited a diffusion effect towards the south and a polarization effect towards the north. Furthermore, centered around Beijing, the closer the distance, the more pronounced the effects observed.</p>
    <p> Based on these findings, this paper proposes recommendations for promoting the coor- dinated and interconnected development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. These recommendations include government-led efforts to break down administrative barriers, focusing on the flow of educational resources and innovation outcomes, strengthening the interrelatedness of industrial structures, promoting advanced industri- alization, mitigating household registration disparities, and advancing deeper integration of public services.</p>

  <h1> Analysis of the Current Carbon Emission Intensity and Influencing Factors in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region.</h1>

  <h2>Content :</h2>
 
  <p>Beijing Tianjin Hebei region is the economic center of the north of China. Therefore, using county-level panel data to analyse the carbon emission of Beijing Tianjin Hebei region is impor- tant to achieve the dual carbon goal. According to the energy consumption and NPP / VIRRS nighttime light data from 2013 to 2019, we calculate the carbon dioxide emission quantity and the carbon dioxide emission intensity. We constructed he STIRPAT model with individual and time double fixed effects, using the instrumental variable method, then searched possible factors affecting the regional carbon emission intensity at county level.</p>
  <p>The results show that: firstly, the total carbon emission of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei showed a downward trend from 2013 to 2019. However, the reduction rates of the three provinces vary significantly. Beijing has the fastest carbon emission reduction rate, followed by Tianjin, and then Hebei Province. Secondly, for elements affecting carbon emissions, it can be seen that the regional population (lnPOPU), the degree of industrial upgrading (SENI) and the proportion of secondary industry in the regional GDP (pSEC) are significantly negatively correlated with the regional carbon emission intensity. Lastly, the economic development level and industrial structure of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei are quite different, the factors affecting carbon emission intensity are also different.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the government should develop the regional industrial structure of Beijing, Tian- jin and Hebei, establish a reasonable carbon tax collection system and build an effective carbon emission trading market.</p>
